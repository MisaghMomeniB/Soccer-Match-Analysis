## 💡 Overview

This repository is aimed at processing **soccer match event data** to generate performance metrics—pass accuracy, shots on target, possession rates, heatmaps—and visual reports. It can be used for analytics, coaching insights, or personal study.

---

## ✅ Features

- 📥 Parse/clean soccer event data (passes, shots, fouls, etc.)  
- 📉 Compute per-match and per-player statistics (accuracy, efficiency, involvement)  
- 📊 Visual outputs: bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps  
- 🔄 Comparative analysis between teams or players  
- 🧠 Optional ML clustering of playing styles or event patterns

---

## 🗂️ Data & Approach

- **Input data**: CSV or JSON with event-level details (timestamp, event type, position, player/team ID)  
- **Cleaning**: Standardize missing values, convert coordinates to suitable ranges  
- **Aggregation**: Compute:
  - Pass success rate = passes completed / passes attempted
  - Shots on target vs total shots
  - Possession % measured through event duration  
- **Output**:  
  - Tables (CSV/JSON) with aggregated metrics  
  - Visualizations (PNG/interactive HTML)

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Setup environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MisaghMomeniB/Soccer-Match-Analysis.git
cd Soccer-Match-Analysis
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Prepare your data

* Ensure `data/` folder contains `match_events.csv` (or `.json`)
* File must include columns like: `match_id, team_id, player_id, event_type, x, y, timestamp`

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 🧮 Generate Metrics

```bash
python src/analyze_match.py --input data/match_events.csv --output reports/match_summary.json
```

This produces match and player statistics in JSON or CSV format.

### 📊 Create Visualizations

```bash
python src/plot_heatmap.py --input reports/match_summary.json --player 10
```

Generates a positional heatmap for player ID 10.

---

## 📈 Visualization & Reporting

All plot scripts generate:

* **Heatmaps** showing player movement and concentration
* **Bar charts** for pass accuracy, shot efficiency, possession
* **Line charts** for time-series trends (e.g., possession over match time)

Reports saved to `reports/` with filenames like `team_comparison.png`.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **pandas**, **NumPy** for data processing
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** for plotting
* **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory analysis

---

## 🤝 Contributing
